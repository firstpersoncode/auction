## Architecure

#### Overview

The web app is an online auction system where users can create and bid on items, it also includes a deposit feature.

#### Client-side:

- HTML and CSS: Responsible for presenting the user interface (UI) and handling user interactions.

- React.js and Javascript: Facilitates UI development and provides a structured approach to manage client-side logic.

#### Server-side:

- Next.js: Handles back-end, consume database, renders the front-end, request handling, and routing.

- MongoDB: Stores and retrieves items, bids, user information, and balance.

#### Communication:

- RESTful APIs: Enable communication between the client-side and server-side components, allowing data retrieval and submission.

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): Used for data serialization and exchange between the client and server.

#### Security:

- Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS): Encrypts data transmission to protect sensitive information.

- Input validation and sanitization: Prevents common security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).

- Normalize response: Helps mitigate security risks and ensures that the response does not contain any potentially harmful content that could be exploited by attackers.

#### Infrastructure:

- DigitalOcean:

  - Services that run the client-side and server-side components.

  - Serve static files.

  - Provide the pipeline between the repositories and the services.

  - Provide logs of the deployment process and status of the services for monitoring.

- Atlas: Cloud Database that hosts the MongoDB clusters.

- NameCheap: Domain provider used for hosting the web app domain.

- Github: Repository of the web app source code.

# Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash

yarn  install

# or

npm  install

# or

pnpm  install

```

then, run the development server:

```bash

npm  run  dev

# or

yarn  dev

# or

pnpm  dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

## The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Project Structure

This documentation provides an overview of the project structure within a Next.js app, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) paradigm. The project structure emphasizes a clear separation of concerns and a modular approach to organizing code.

### Folder Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
`root
|-- models
|   |-- (all entity files)
|   |-- connect.ts (database connection file)
|-- pages
|   |-- api
|   |   |-- (all the API handlers)
|   |-- _app.tsx
|   |-- index.tsx (the frontend page)
|-- components
|   |-- (all component files here)
|-- context
|   |-- global.tsx`
```

### `models` Folder

The `models` folder contains entity files and a database connection file. It is responsible for defining the data models, interacting with the database, and managing database connections.

### `pages` Folder

The `pages` folder contains the routing configuration for the app, including API routes and frontend pages. It follows the convention of Next.js for creating pages and routing.

- `api` subfolder: This subfolder contains all the API handler files responsible for handling incoming API requests. These handlers act as connectors and controllers between the models and views, executing the necessary logic and returning appropriate responses.
- `_app.tsx`: This file represents the Next.js `_app` component, which serves as a wrapper for all pages and provides a common layout or global configurations. It can be used to set up context providers or add global styles and scripts.
- `index.tsx`: This file represents the main frontend page of the app. It serves as the entry point for the app's UI, rendering the necessary components and interacting with the ViewModel or global state.

### `components` Folder

The `components` folder contains all the React components used in the app. These components act as the "View" layer in the MVVM paradigm and are responsible for rendering UI elements and handling user interactions. They may also make requests to the API and call handlers provided by the global context to update the global state.

### `context` Folder

The `context` folder includes files related to the global context, which controls the global state of the app. It follows the ViewModel pattern in the MVVM paradigm.

- `global.tsx`: This file represents the global context file, which defines the context provider and manages the global state of the app. It can include state variables, actions, and handlers that update the state. The components within the `components` folder can access and interact with this global context to maintain a consistent state across the app.

## MVVM Paradigm

The project structure described above follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) paradigm, which separates concerns and promotes a modular approach to development.

- **Model**: The "Model" layer represents the data and business logic of the app. It typically includes data models, database interactions, and other business-related operations. In the provided structure, models are not explicitly defined, but they can be incorporated within the API handlers located in the `pages/api` folder.
- **View**: The "View" layer is responsible for rendering the UI elements and handling user interactions. It includes the components located in the `components` folder, which are purely focused on the presentation logic and do not contain complex business logic.
- **ViewModel**: In this project structure, the "ViewModel" layer is represented by the global context defined in the `context/global.tsx` file. The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and View layers, providing access to the global state and handling state updates. Components in the `components` folder can interact with the ViewModel to read and update the global state.

## The separation of concerns in this project structure adheres to the MVVM paradigm, allowing for maintainable, testable, and scalable code. The components in the "View" layer are decoupled from the business logic and can easily be reused or modified independently. The global context serves as the central point

## API Unit Test

This unit test file tests all the APIs within the Next.js app using Jest framework.

### Test Execution

To run the unit test, follow these steps:

1.  Ensure that you have the project dependencies installed by running the command `npm install` or `yarn install`.
2.  Ensure that you have the `.env.test` file that contains:

```bash
DB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<your cluster domain>/test
JWT_KEY=secret
TOKEN_NAME=__test-session__
```

3.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
4.  Execute the following command to run the unit tests:

    ```bash
    yarn test

    #or

    npm run test
    ```

    This command will execute all the unit tests defined in the `__test__/api.ts` file.

### Test File Location

The unit test file `api.ts` is located in the `__test__` directory at the root of the project.

```
`project-root
├── __tests__
│   └── api.ts
├── ...`
```

### Test Cases

The unit test file `api.ts` includes the following test cases:
